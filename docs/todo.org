* clustering

- reason dataset -> arguments (plain text), labels
- l1 logistic classifier
- clustering

* tuning

- model size
- dropout rate
- try init with scale 1.0
- try logit embed sharing
- try separate relu layers for mu and lv

* attentional encoder

- bidirectional rnn
- final state as query
- outputs as values

* convolutional decoder

since we don't need to use the decoder for generation,
it does not have to be generative/autoregressive.
consider a transposed convolutional network.
