* clustering

- reason dataset -> arguments (plain text), labels
- l1 logistic classifier
- clustering

* tuning

- word dropout (see log)
- attention (see log)
- relu layers (see log)
- learning rate
- model size

* convolutional decoder

since we don't need to use the decoder for generation,
it does not have to be generative/autoregressive.
consider a transposed convolutional network.
