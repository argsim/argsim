the point i was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion until.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. and geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we?

25,"no my dear you do not obviously know the law. our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy without any confirmation from him. he does not even have to know, even if he is the father. if he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. that is the law. the fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ€¦.she took the risk. the sperm leaves his body...and enters her. his part is done. the sperm was a gift, he certainly canâ€™t ask for it back can he? lol she holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâ€™s not an issue. of course i am a christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today. i believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. like i said today she can kill and he need not even know it. i talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs. you said itâ€™s unfair........why? you are trying to make yourself feel better look better. you are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing. you said, â€œit's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful christian you are! why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. the man is just as responsible for pregnancy he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â€? am i calling names? didnâ€™t you call me a pig? better reread that section. am i insulting you because you are pro-abortion? well gee i am sorry, the truth hurts. you said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ€¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it. now if the way i described it sounds crassâ€¦sorry, but i was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be christian in fact. that does not change the fact how they got pregnant. why donâ€™t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? it still wonâ€™t change the truth of how it happened. as i said againâ€¦â€¦â€¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ€¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. is that better way to put it? you are absolutely unbelievable. you want to blameâ€¦â€¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâ€™s issue, so says the law. what do you not get? donâ€™t you have the guts to call it like it is? if the man is accountable wouldnâ€™t he have a decision in the pregnancy? no the government says no. he is not an issue and he is not responsible. as for condemning anyone for an abortionâ€¦this discussion is not about that. i work with women who have had abortionsâ€¦.because i know what itâ€™s like, i had one. i was one of those women who spread her legs. it was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony i suffered was on me as it should be. so donâ€™t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. the work i do is in this field, i see the pain, especially afterwards. and guess whatâ€¦â€¦â€¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. the woman calls the shots as i did when i had mine some thirty years ago. i would give anything to be able to take that day backâ€¦and i know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way. you are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ€¦because you simply condone others the right to kill. were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into hitlerâ€™s ovensâ€¦ pro-life? how about those people that owned slaves? would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one? and do you have to use the f bomb in order to debate? is it an effective way to get your point across? of course you will retaliateâ€¦you condone abortion which is violence. you ranted onâ€¦â€¦â€˜you are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. how dare you say i contribute to abortion. if a woman asked me if she should have an abortion i'd say 'it's up to you, it's your choice'. i wouldn't judge her, i wouldn't influence her opinion. if someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â€? i was making an analogy that you simply did not like. well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? how about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? if someone drives someone to a robberyâ€¦.and they are caughtâ€¦.does the police just sayâ€¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? i mean come on. if you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. if the doctor didnâ€™t show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ€¦the baby might have a chance. you said, â€œ yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence i think it's okay before then. pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. i don't have to be entirely pro abortion. just like i wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance i would like if my daughter was starving i'd steal food for her without a second thought. again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful christian you are. you can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. not to mention you lie. very godly.â€? youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny. bolongaâ€¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ€¦.not just because of pain. insult? retaliation, isnâ€™t that what itâ€™s all about, you said so yourself didnâ€™t you? then you judge me when you think i retaliateâ€¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ€¦â€¦â€¦? lol oh yes because i am a christian, right. am i supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things that are unchristian? no case for abortion can be made scripturally. christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until i came to him. so you donâ€™t like how i put thingsâ€¦â€¦..christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well. i am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. you might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal. you said,â€œ is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? you're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. if you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â€? i said, if a woman and man are marriedâ€¦â€¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. he has no rights even though it is his child. but he would be held legally responsible for child support if he did not want the child and wanted her to get an abortion. she calls the shots. now if they were not married, she canâ€™t hold him financially accountable for anything. the baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificateâ€¦and in that case he might for forced to pay. you said, â€œwhat? a date i randomly made up? no the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. and the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, i linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. which is where i get my opinion on when i think abortion is okay.â€? well you are wrong againâ€¦. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ james_elgin_gill 128 days earlyâ€¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early then there was amillia taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. she was born on 24 october 2006 in miami, florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. at birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). she suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. she was discharged from the baptist children's hospital on 20 february 2007. there are babies like this all over the world being born. my niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. she spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. she weighed just over 1 pound. i know the information out thereâ€¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting. pain is not an issueâ€¦.personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all. â€œif i had no worth for the womb why would i have a child?"" you value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....????? yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",abortion,c-bad_4_mom,36,119.84813,1,67.19941,2,0.2672531008720398,1,0.2794932723045349
26,"no my dear you do not obviously know the law. our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy without any confirmation from him when did i say that wasn't the law. do you read anything i type? the fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ€¦.she took the risk. tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. can a woman conceive on her own? can a man produce a child on his own? no. both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception. the sperm was a gift, he certainly canâ€™t ask for it back can he? what? answer this question please. does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? yes he knows all of these things. and yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. therefore he is half responsible. he is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman. i believe personally that the man should be considered.... if the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds . which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you? like i said today she can kill and he need not even know it. i talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs well if they talk about it they obviously know about it. you said itâ€™s unfair........why? i said what's unfair? am i calling names? here's a list! directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. is this what the word of jesus taught you do? name call? materialist judge mental you look silly your ignorant you are cold. you champion killing sissy hitler, margaret sanger. your views on this mirror theirs. you are a joke youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny you respresent death to innocent human beings didnâ€™t you call me a pig? better reread that section you deserved to be called a pig. i hate sexism. i'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what i said i never denied that i called you a name. hypocrite. all you've done since this debate began is name call, i will retaliate. i'm not the one in denial. i called you a pig once. you've demeaned and name called multiple times. you said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ€¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it. i know and your point is? most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be christian in fact. that does not change the fact how they got pregnant. why donâ€™t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? it still wonâ€™t change the truth of how it happened. what on earth are you on about? i've had sex i know what sex entails, i know how a child is conceived. you said this it got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. she is the one taking the risk...not the man this is sexist, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. of course he does. could a woman get pregnant without a man? no. therefore the man has to assume half the responsibility for a child being conceived. there are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. half and half. they both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. they are both responsible. as i said againâ€¦â€¦â€¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ€¦.that is if he is not married an unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. for someone who claims that i know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself. girl who is allowing him in the man also allows himself in. stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. if the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. if he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. just as the girl could say no or use a condom. they both take equal blame. donâ€™t you have the guts to call it like it is? if the man is accountable wouldnâ€™t he have a decision in the pregnancy? how, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? that is how it is i'm afraid. it takes a man and a woman to procreate. they both did it. he doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh god do i have to repeat myself again...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. it's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. and if you read what i say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement. as for condemning anyone for an abortionâ€¦this discussion is not about that seriously? all you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion. because i know what itâ€™s like, i had one i'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean i can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. how dare you tell me i contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when i've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one. i was one of those women who spread her legs. it was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony i suffered was on me as it should be. in a sense i'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. and i actually feel very sorry for you. someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. the person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. it takes two people to make a child. you cannot create a life on your own. so donâ€™t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through again stop lying about things i've said. i never said i did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of americans have that i hate. telling someone 'i know how you feel'. i see the pain, especially afterwards i have friends and family who have had abortions i would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. it's abortion. i never said it was happy fairy la la land. however they could have felt worse if they had a child. what about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? do their emotions mean nothing? but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children i'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when i haven't even spoken a word about this. who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? how selfish. i would give anything to be able to take that day backâ€¦and i know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way i'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too. you are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ€¦because you simply condone others the right to kill not pro-choice thanks. i have a limit. that's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' it makes no sense. were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into hitlerâ€™s ovensâ€¦ pro-life? what has the holocaust got to do with abortion. since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion. how about those people that owned slaves? would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one? again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. of course i wouldn't and i wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now. and do you have to use the f bomb in order to debate? is it an effective way to get your point across? i sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer. of course you will retaliateâ€¦you condone abortion which is violence. i don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion? youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny. bolongaâ€¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ€¦.not just because of pain i didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. stop lying. i'm not scared of what's beyond it, i don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. and if it was true, which i don't believe it is, everyone i love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of god, i'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you. i was making an analogy that you simply did not like. well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? how about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? you accused me of having the same views as a nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. and now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are nazi's? by the way i am none of these examples and i've never contributed to an abortion. do you think you are a nazi and a racist murderer? since you had an abortion? abortions are free here. and i also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. they aren't performed like that anymore. http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/pages/how-is-it-performed.aspx then you judge me when you think i retaliateâ€¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ€¦â€¦â€¦ you name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. since revenge is against god's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. i'm not judging you by different standards or religion. i'm just telling you what the bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? are they judging you? so you donâ€™t like how i put thingsâ€¦â€¦..christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well. no i just don't want to be quoted scripture since i don't believe in it as the divine truth. it's worthless quoting the bible to me. i will only accept proven fact as a reliable source. i am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to. but he would be held legally responsible for child support if he did not want the child and wanted her to get an abortion good. if they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway. well you are wrong againâ€¦. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_elgin_gill 128 days earlyâ€¦ or 21 weeks 5 days early http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/ 02/worlds_youngest.htm actually she is. are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue i was one day out on her age. why don't you produce a real argument? there are babies like this all over the world being born. my niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. she spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. she weighed just over 1 pound. for the final time read what i say. or i'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. i said i don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby. i know the information out thereâ€¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting. why because you post things from wikipedia? wow i wish i had that knowledge. don't tell me i need to 'get educated' i think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. the only things i've posted are links and small quotes. everything else is my words. you ask for evidence you get it. you value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....????? i don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. i love my family and friends. that is it. i am not religious or spiritual i do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people i feel genuine love for. i do not love you, i do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. at best i like some random people. that does not mean i don't value other people though, i value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right? what do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? did you want me to pioneer a revolution? do you want to preach to people? sorry i won't and i can't. if i saw an actual baby or child i'd intervene with their death. but what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth? fuck sakes, read my words please. when does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. i already said that about 6 times?",abortion,p-not_human p-sick_mom,18,137.92535,1,115.68656,2,0.48800259828567505,1,0.445320188999176
27,"you said, â€œtell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. can a woman conceive on her own? can a man produce a child on his own? no. both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.â€? it takes two, the woman canâ€™t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. but that has nothing to do with responsibility. our government even though it recognizes the father if they are marriedâ€¦does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. he simply is not an issue. the government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide. if they are both are responsible for the risks they takeâ€¦then why are the fathers rights stripped? you said, â€œanswer this question please. does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? yes he knows all of these things. and yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. therefore he is half responsible. he is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.â€? yes he does. yes he does. yes he does. but, he also knows he can walk away if he doesnâ€™t want to be involved. exampleâ€¦.. two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. they want to have sex obviously for pleasure. they might not even know their names or where they are from. now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? the guy or the gal. who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? the man she takes the big risk. what risk did the kid take? none. this cassie anthony trialâ€¦..she says she has no idea who the father of caylee was. she was known for sleeping around and they did dna samples on many of her acquaintances. nothing turned up. they even did dna on her father and brother. who got pregnant, who had the baby? she didâ€¦because whether reckless sex happened or notâ€¦the risk she took didnâ€™t pan outâ€¦.she got pregnantâ€¦.and where is the dad??????? you said, â€œif the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?â€? well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. in this case i believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him. you said, â€œhere's a list! directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. is this what the word of jesus taught you do? name call?â€? materialist judge mental you look silly your ignorant you are cold. you champion killing sissy hitler, margaret sanger. your views on this mirror theirs. you are a joke youâ€™re so ridiculous itâ€™s not even funny you respresent death to innocent human beings â€œ you also said, â€œyou deserved to be called a pig. i hate sexism. i'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what i said i never denied that i called you a name. hypocrite. all you've done since this debate began is name call, i will retaliate. i'm not the one in denial. i called you a pig once. you've demeaned and name called multiple times.â€?

what i stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible. and why are you bringing religion into this. all these humanists bringing religion into debatesâ€¦when i have not. is it because of my name? again ignoranceâ€¦go research what a churchmouse is. do you think that christians because of the love commandment should just take itâ€¦roll over and play dead? why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. you have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsâ€¦and makes you look like you have no class. you use the f bomb like itâ€™s a conjunction. your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror hitler and sangers and i could add a few more for that matterâ€¦..but will leave it with these two. why donâ€™t you do some heavy research on thisâ€¦not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? your position is heartless, cold, and you like i said are ignorant of the facts. your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life. i said, â€œyou said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ€¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it. you said, i know and your point is?â€? and this is not championing abortion? lmao and you want people to believe your pro-life? lmao i said this, â€œit got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. she is the one taking the risk...not the man then you replied with this. â€œthis is sexist, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. of course he does. could a woman get pregnant without a man? no. therefore the man has to assume half the responsibility for a child being conceived. there are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. half and half. they both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. they are both responsible.â€? why? is biology sexist? the truth is the truth it seeks no sides. we have hashed this over and over and you will never get it iâ€™m afraid. the man does not have to assume squatâ€¦unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. did the kid on the beach have to do anything? how many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes offâ€¦knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman? you said, â€œan unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. for someone who claims that i know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.' not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. bugger? boy have not heard that one since kindergarten. you said, â€œthe man also allows himself in. stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. if the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. if he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. just as the girl could say no or use a condom. they both take equal blame.â€? only because she says yes. he goes on her invite. if they are running around the basesâ€¦have not scored a grand slamâ€¦ and she says noâ€¦â€¦..itâ€™s no, you canâ€™t come in. if he does against her wishes itâ€™s rape. instigating has nothing to do with this. but whose body is changed by the sex act? not his..hers. she knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. he knows that it wonâ€™t affect him in the leastâ€¦..unless he is married. â€œhow, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? that is how it is i'm afraid. it takes a man and a woman to procreate. they both did it. he doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh god do i have to repeat myself again...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. it's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. and if you read what i say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.â€? it does take a man and a woman to procreateâ€¦which is why i also am against same sex unions, itâ€™s not naturalâ€¦but thatâ€™s another debate. they both have sexâ€¦.blah blahâ€¦â€¦..and as i said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. so who takes the big risk? sure some married couples are on the same pageâ€¦.but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. there is no way of knowing that statistic. you said, â€œseriously? all you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion. not true. i state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. you champion killing so you donâ€™t want to see the evidence. you want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold. you said, â€œi'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean i can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. how dare you tell me i contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when i've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.â€? why on earth would you of all people be sorry? mind boggling to say the least. i am not a hypocrite, i simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. my kind of story is the one pp does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way. tell meâ€¦â€¦have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnâ€™t believe that way all along? are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? what?...we canâ€™t change our minds about issues, feelings? must be nice to be perfect. well my position on abortion changedâ€¦.and i am allowed to change my mindâ€¦..are you? when you make a huge mistakeâ€¦.if you have children donâ€™t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? what youâ€™re saying hereâ€¦.is that i do not have the right to change my mind, i donâ€™t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? you are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ€¦.. but then youâ€™re perfect remember? â€œin a sense i'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. and i actually feel very sorry for you. someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. the person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. it takes two people to make a child. you cannot create a life on your own.â€? oh my goodness donâ€™t. i was not a child when i had itâ€¦.i should have known betterâ€¦and i took the risk because i knew what would happen. but like most others in the heat of passion i guess i didnâ€™t care and did it anyway. no one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, i do not blame anyone but myself. i am a wonderful person most of the time, not perfect like you but i am ok. i have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the same manâ€¦.and have a blessed life. christ forgave me when i became his. and i promised him that abortion would be my witnessâ€¦to share what he did for me in my hour of need. i am the luckiest person in the world. the baby i aborted was my husbands. a pregnancy at that time would have been hard. we were on the same pageâ€¦until laterâ€¦when i started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. he was supportive but of course our faiths in god are different, because when i became christs, he didnâ€™t. worldviews changeâ€¦.and mine did drastically. we have adjustedâ€¦and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. i do not force my beliefs on him. i pray someday we will be on the same page. you said, â€œi have friends and family who have had abortions i would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. it's abortion. i never said it was happy fairy la la land. however they could have felt worse if they had a child. what about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? do their emotions mean nothing?â€? distraught about what? tell meâ€¦.how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ€¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? i donâ€™t get it. abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. have you ever seen one? anyone who does not see one and think itâ€™s horrendousâ€¦is cold, compassionless and empty. here watch thisâ€¦â€¦..and if you donâ€™t, think about the reasons why you wonâ€™t. search your heartâ€¦about why you would support something so barbaric. and if you have childrenâ€¦.put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered. http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13 i am not catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion. â€œi'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when i haven't even spoken a word about this. who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? how selfish.â€? what is upsetting about it? and who says the kids are young? i wouldnâ€™t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. i would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. i told my kids when they were teenagers. itâ€™s not selfishâ€¦its real life and it happens. kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. what makes abortion different you tell me? itâ€™s the most performed surgery in the world. i said, â€œyou are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ€¦because you simply condone others the right to kill you said, â€œnot pro-choice thanks. i have a limit. that's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' it makes no sense.â€? you are pro-abortion period, end of story. you want to deceive yourself into thinking youâ€™re not but you are. you condone what that video i wanted you to watchâ€¦shows. thatâ€™s what you think should be legal. you do not stand up for all life. â€œwhat has the holocaust got to do with abortion. since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.â€? well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ€¦.and looked the other way. in a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. everyone participatedâ€¦â€¦good should have overcome evil, but didnâ€™t. people act out of fearâ€¦.and i am sure there were people who did not like what hitler was doing but didnâ€™t do anything to stop himâ€¦i am talking about the people in his own countryâ€¦.the people who could have physically taken himoutâ€¦.the guards, etc. abortion is like thatâ€¦.people sit by and do nothingâ€¦.they think anything they doâ€¦.wonâ€™t change the laws, wonâ€™t help the victim. but if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ€¦.if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and goodâ€¦â€¦.abortion would once again be considered murder. if we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortionâ€¦.wowâ€¦.how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. but we are a secular country that has turned its face from godâ€¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. i work with people who are atheistsâ€¦.so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evilâ€¦â€¦â€¦..standing up for it, no matter what. you said, â€œagain what does having a slave have to do with abortion. of course i wouldn't and i wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.â€? again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thingâ€¦â€¦..even if you are swimming up stream. i know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to noneâ€¦â€¦but i keep working and praying i am wrong. society is sinking into a moral less abyss. you said, â€œi sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.â€? you condone murderâ€¦.i never called you a racist. you said, â€œi don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?â€? i never use violent adjectives on youâ€¦.you used a noun to describe me. and swearing is classlessâ€¦ . â€œi didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. stop lying. i'm not scared of what's beyond it, i don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. and if it was true, which i don't believe it is, everyone i love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of god, i'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.â€? well you hold the cards to your future eternity. no one else is responsible but you. and if youâ€™re wrongâ€¦you will have all eternity to think about it. how do you know everyone has been condemned? and how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? if you went to hell with themâ€¦..being with family etcâ€¦would be just a tad bit goodâ€¦you would have support, be near the ones you love. and if you have support, then it is not hell. lol what happens if you get there and you canâ€™t find anyone? well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them i suppose. i know many people in my family who will not goâ€¦that is their choice. i bothers me, and i cry about it sometimes when i am praying. but i love christ more than any other person in the worldâ€¦.and i have faith in himâ€¦.more than i have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. i believe that i will not know if any family does not make it. heaven is perfectâ€¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved. â€œyou name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. since revenge is against god's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. i'm not judging you by different standards or religion. i'm just telling you what the bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? are they judging you?â€? itâ€™s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. lol i do not feel i called you names. i described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. i am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. i am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. i am bold, and i do state the facts in ways people feel offended. but i think down inside they are offended because what i say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. and you think abortion is ok. andâ€¦.you are judging meâ€¦i point out what you say that are untruths but i am not judging your heartâ€¦.i canâ€™t, scripture does not allow me to do thatâ€¦not unless you claim to be a christian. that is why i bring no scriptures up with you because you donâ€™t know better. god will judge you. i can however judge actions (not hearts) of christians as they can judge mine and many have done thatâ€¦i thank them for it because many times more than i would like to admit, i needed judgement. why do you quote a book you donâ€™t believe in? lol you said, â€œno i just don't want to be quoted scripture since i don't believe in it as the divine truth. it's worthless quoting the bible to me. i will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.â€? you donâ€™t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. lol you said, â€œi said i don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â€? you are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ€¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own. you said, â€œwhy because you post things from wikipedia? wow i wish i had that knowledge. don't tell me i need to 'get educated' i think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. the only things i've posted are links and small quotes. everything else is my words. you ask for evidence you get it.â€? lol boy you are really diggin deep nowâ€¦. i post rarely from wikipediaâ€¦.and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. i am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ€¦.so i could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. i workâ€¦.i live a full life and when i get on hereâ€¦.i slam it out the fastest way i can. if i had to hand in an article or paper â€¦.it would be correct. you have provided however little evidence, more lies. just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ€¦.i showed you your error. i work in this field and i knowâ€¦. â€œi don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. i love my family and friends. that is it. i am not religious or spiritual i do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people i feel genuine love for. i do not love you, i do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. at best i like some random people. that does not mean i don't value other people though, i value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.câ€? this is your worldviewâ€¦and explains what i said all alongâ€¦why you are pro-abortion. the lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. i feel sorry for you actually. you said, â€œwhat do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? did you want me to pioneer a revolution? do you want to preach to people? sorry i won't and i can't. if i saw an actual baby or child i'd intervene with their death. but what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth? fuck sakes, read my words please. when does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. i already said that about 6 times?â€? who is setting abortion clinics on fire? if you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the worldâ€¦â€¦its nothing. pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the lawâ€¦just try to change it. am i preaching? what is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what i am doing? do you ever look in a mirror? you simply act like a juvenile. you have no class... you do not even know what you are saying. lol you said two things in your postâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeksâ€¦.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. lol canâ€™t let this one goâ€¦â€¦your hilarious. i mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. lol this is what you said earlierâ€¦ you said, â€œi said i don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â€? so is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel painâ€¦.or 24 weeks when obviously it canâ€™t. lol you do not even know your own position. that is why you look silly and have to swear. do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? lol nawâ€¦you donâ€™t.",abortion,c-kill,0,135.00266,0,131.45723,189,0.6059667468070984,188,0.573529839515686
28,"our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity. well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. in this case i believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him no, no, no. if he is considered on all grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead. and you want to compare your use of the noun pigâ€¦to the descriptions i have used? do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? you also called me a sissy? sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. it's not an adjective. brush up on your english language. it makes no difference if i said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp. how old are you really, are you even an adult? what i stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible. i'm a fully fledged adult. it is not the truth it's your opinion. and i'm arrogant yet your feelings have to be the truth? and why are you bringing religion into this. all these humanists bringing religion into debatesâ€¦when i have not. yay another list for me to make. things you have said religiously to back your opinion: he was supportive but of course our faiths in god are different, because when i became christs, but if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ€¦ but we are a secular country that has turned its face from godâ€¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. but i love christ more than any other person in the worldâ€¦.and i have faith in himâ€¦.more than i have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. i believe that i will not know if any family does not make it. heaven is perfectâ€¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved i can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this. you have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsâ€¦and makes you look like you have no class. no, a swear word is a word. it means nothing. oh look another insult to me. why thank you very much. and i'm not 'classy' it's not something i can aspire to with all my tattoos! your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror hitler and sangers and i could add a few more for that matterâ€¦..but will leave it with these two i think a few re reads are in order here. read their opinion and read mine. it's not even comparible. why donâ€™t you do some heavy research on thisâ€¦not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? your position is heartless, cold, and you like i said are ignorant of the facts. my education is nursing. i am going into midwifrey i can assure i need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. my opinion is what you think is heartless and cold. to many others it is acceptable and logic. don't speak for the world . your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life. i'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. and if the last resort is an abortion then i accept that. i don't champion killing, i don't tell anyone to abort and i don't abort myself. i just understand why people do. why? is biology sexist? the truth is the truth it seeks no sides. we have hashed this over and over and you will never get it iâ€™m afraid. the man does not have to assume squatâ€¦unless he is married and the courts order him to pay biology isn't sexist again i study it. the context in which you describe things is sexist. the truth is what you perceive it to be. the truth is never what you think. yes he does. if i had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support. they both have sexâ€¦.blah blahâ€¦â€¦..and as i said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. so who takes the big risk? my fiance and i weren't married. he took responsibility. he admits he took the risk even though i was on contraception. stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion. not true. i state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. you champion killing so you donâ€™t want to see the evidence. no you don't. you've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which i'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. i post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. i use my evidence you use yours. why does it matter? not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. bugger? boy have not heard that one since kindergarten. because my opinion differs to yours i'm uneducated? no, i have educated myself and come to a conclusion. you have come to a conclusion i'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. that's the difference between you and i, i can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. you're a forcer, you think that everyone has to share your opinion or they're a bad person. and educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in england. why on earth would you of all people be sorry? mind boggling to say the least. so because i believe woman have the right to abortion i no longer have feelings. i feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. stop word twisting. my kind of story is the one pp does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way it's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim i want abortion to be seen positively. consistence in the key in debating. something you clearly don't have. tell meâ€¦â€¦have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnâ€™t believe that way all along? are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? what?...we canâ€™t change our minds about issues, feelings? must be nice to be perfect. well my position on abortion changedâ€¦.and i am allowed to change my mindâ€¦..are you? yes and yes. i never denied this fact so i guess i'll just answer the first two questions. you can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and i never claimed it to be. i'm allowed to change my mind, i probably won't on this topic though. what youâ€™re saying hereâ€¦.is that i do not have the right to change my mind, i donâ€™t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? you are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ€¦.. but then youâ€™re perfect remember? no i'm not. i'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. again i'm aware of the consequences of abortion. are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? explain to me exactly when i have judged someone and acted arrogantly? thanks for calling me perfect all the time. i don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason. when you make a huge mistakeâ€¦.if you have children donâ€™t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? i protect my child and i will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. but i'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. i won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. a lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. if my daughter was ever pregnant i'd help her. if she asks for the pros and cons i will tell her. if she asks me what to do i will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. why? because her happiness is the most important thing to me. well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ€¦.and looked the other way. in a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. everyone participatedâ€¦â€¦good should have overcome evil, but didnâ€™t. people stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. and people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. they didn't let jews get gassed. everyone participated? that's a wild claim to make. most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that. oh my goodness donâ€™t. i was not a child when i had itâ€¦. did i say you were? i am a wonderful person most of the time, not perfect like you but i am ok. and i'm arrogant. stop calling me perfect, i'm blushing. i have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the same manâ€¦.and have a blessed life. great. i have a wonderful child to. this means nothing to the debate subject. and being with same man isn't an accomplishment. it's a choice. i am the luckiest person in the world. the baby i aborted was my husbands. a pregnancy at that time would have been hard. you aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? or that they're like hitler? that they are murderers? come off your high horse.. distraught about what? having an abortion, derp. how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ€¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? it is a horrible experience. my morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances. abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. have you ever seen one? anyone who does not see one and think itâ€™s horrendousâ€¦anyone who does not see one and think itâ€™s horrendousâ€¦is cold, compassionless and empty. abortion is horrible, i've seen many. (the nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). it's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. you yourself said it's emotionless. how can it be empty then? i'm a bad person even though i assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? and because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers? what is upsetting about it? and who says the kids are young? of course abortion is upsetting for a child. the word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? i thought that was common knowledge. i told my kids when they were teenagers. itâ€™s not selfishâ€¦its real life and it happens. so they weren't children.... kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. what makes abortion different you tell me? abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. watching south park doesn't. lol i do not feel i called you names. i described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with well i listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. of course i have problem with racism. you are pro-abortion period, end of story. you want to deceive yourself into thinking youâ€™re not but you are. you condone what that video i wanted you to watchâ€¦shows. thatâ€™s what you think should be legal. you do not stand up for all life no you think i am pro abortion. i know i'm not. i am neutral if anything. i don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe i am so you can preach. even if i was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. i stand up for life especially those already born. i stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start. . i am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. i no you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. because you don't like my opinion you assume i am an awful person. you condone murderâ€¦.i never called you a racist you said i had the same opinion as hitler and margaret who are racist. so yes you did. i am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. i am bold, and i do state the facts in ways people feel offended. but i think down inside they are offended because what i say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. and you think abortion is ok. andâ€¦.you are judging meâ€¦ no you're not. you are trying to warp my opinion and claim i am a bad person because of it. your opinion is not right to everyone. just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. you just offend people by dismissing anything they say. you haven't exposed me. my opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. i never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion. i point out what you say that are untruths they're not untruths, you believe they are. just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong. why do you quote a book you donâ€™t believe in? not once have i quoted the bible. perhaps say when? didn't think you could... you are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ€¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own. again your opinion is not fact. you think i am pro-abort it doesn't make it true. i am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ€¦.so i could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. i workâ€¦.i live a full life and when i get on hereâ€¦.i slam it out the fastest way i can. if i had to hand in an article or paper â€¦.it would be correct. great, i study work and have a 8 month old. i still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly. you have provided however little evidence, more lies. just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ€¦.i showed you your error. i work in this field and i knowâ€¦ i haven't lied once. you constantly lie, i pointed out every lie. all my scientific evidence i have posted with my debate. i don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. i work in this field idiot. nurse/midwife mean anything to you? this is your worldviewâ€¦and explains what i said all alongâ€¦why you are pro-abortion. the lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. i feel sorry for you actually. it doesn't explain anything. i said i value people i just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. i can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. i certainly would never love you. worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. since i have no belief in religion i feel what i feel is right. don't feel sorry for me i'm so happy and fulfilled with my life. am i preaching? what is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what i am doing? do you ever look in a mirror? huge difference. i haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. you tell me i am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. i accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. you place no actual evidence just your opinion. your opinion is not fact. you said two things in your postâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeksâ€¦.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. lol ever heard of reading? it will do your argument good. they feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and i think abortion should happen before that. honestly, you liar, i said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong. so is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel painâ€¦.or 24 weeks when obviously it canâ€™t. lol you do not even know your own position. that is why you look silly and have to swear. do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? lol nawâ€¦you donâ€™t. yes it is 12-14 weeks. like i said all along. what the hell are you talking about? i said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. i know my position. i swear because i want to. i like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. yes i know when. the fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again i've said that all along.",abortion,p-not_human p-right,4,110.5741,6,117.55874,1,0.6214863061904907,0,0.5815486311912537

56,"i said there is good and evil and mostly gray, don't mince my words. rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil. but even rape has neutrality in it. let's say you rape someone as evil as hitler, a murderer of innocent people. is that evil? no. fighting evil with evil is not evil, it is neutral. there is only one truth, yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is. human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things. you can't, i can't. therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions. my abortion belief is not opinionated in any way, and that's what separates me from you. it's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people. is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas? no. and yes, there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong. have you no imagination? here's a scenario: you are an adult, and you make great friends with a teenager; one day, you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them. is that love wrong? just because there is an age gap? not necessarily. not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are. what hitler did was wrong, did i dispute that it wasn't? but in fact, it was gray in some areas. why? because he saved germany. he did more evil then good, but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil. the 9/11 bombers were wrong to, but you have to realize, they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing, where they starved to death whilst people like american's were getting hundreds of divorces every day. yes, they killed people, but they suffered and died for their actions. even in those acts, there was balance, despite being mostly evil. it's meant to be contradictory. i don't believe in either radical, i trust in the balance between the two which i explained. why are you arguing as if i believe in both of them at the same time? i'm not pro-choice, i'm just on this side of the debate. the fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point. just because we judge doesn't mean we know. i know facts when i speak of my abortion ideas, but i do not know facts when i make opinions of you. you're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do i, because i don't have opinions about this, i know facts about this. that's what i base my morality on. i don't care what the dictionary says. use your own definition for a human being. what separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul. just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. a mushroom is alive. is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? no, it has no consciousness. a severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? no. it has no consciousness. what about a human finger? is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? no. to say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy. yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. you think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? they do. they feel and think and have a soul. people in commas are sleeping. for a long time. they think and feel and have a soul. vegetable people are not human. they brains are dead. they feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. they are vegetables. are vegetables people? no. the person they were died with their brains. so yes, vegetable people are soulless piece of meat . i know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. we have machines to tell this. what you do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness. also, yes, i am god. i am a pantheist. but that has nothing to do with this debate. if humanists mention souls, then apparently i'm not a humanist. duh. no, i am not a butcher, but anyone can be a butcher if they want. the point is that masses of meat aren't human, dummy. just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human. just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness. so no, i am not being unscientific at all, nor grotesque and insane. you're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything i say in a manner that it does not mean. abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. but the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong. stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research. though, killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting. that intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious. once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't. i'm all over on what? abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. once it's human, it's wrong. what's complicated about that? i know when a fetus is human, i can prove it. you can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness. yes, i do, you do not need to provide a link. no, i did not say that, i gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. i've already said 3 or 4 times that i do not agree with either extreme point, i'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life. no, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. what you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense. what is wrong with you?",abortion,p-not_human,31,126.357834,41,127.89149,62,0.5392420291900635,62,0.5390764474868774

58,"no, i see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. you forgot to listen to me again. the gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety. cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. the same goes for rape and murder. you think murder is acceptable in a place like china or kuwait because they have different cultures then us? it isn't. because culture does not bypass morality. the human mind does. evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. but harm is not. if you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. the ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. what you need to understand is that harm is infallible. it doesn't matter if hitler's nazis thought they were murdering evil jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. just because a group of christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. harm is not subjective. it is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive. it's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance. stop calling you names? no. you look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything i'm saying. my example is not sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! you think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, and consenting teenager? i said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. does your morality really only go so far as the law does? what's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? the difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. a teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. and if the teenager is a little young and doesn't have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? there's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. it's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? do you not see the whole in that logic? a consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. some underage teenagers, on the other hand, are , by mathematical probability. mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me. facts i know about abortion? facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. that's a fact. duh. i've said that about a dozen times to you. it's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything i've been saying by asking for the facts i've been repeating to you over and over again. yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. it has a consciousness. before that certain point, it has no consciousness. now, i'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on: what is your proof that a fetus is a human being before it has a consciousness? i agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. you think that it's always a human being, period. give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not. i'm not 'pro-abortion'. i have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. stop saying that i'm 'pro-abortion' before i decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop. yup, i'm god. everything is god. you're god to, you know. no, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. if it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong? cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong. the same applies to lying and stealing. example for lying: you're a jew living in germany. it's 1938. you look a little more german then jewish. nazis ask you if you and your family are jewish. you lie and say you're not jewish. you save your family and yourself. if you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. have an imagination that factors in circumstance. example of stealing: you're poor and starving. so is your family. a rich man leaves his car unlocked. his wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. you steal the money and leave the wallet. you stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. if you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of robin hood . child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. abuse is to harm someone for no reason. harm is infallible. child abuse is never right. i do not defend evil. i defend only good. you are just a humongous idiot. in fact, you defend evil if you think that the jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life. do you support these things? i hope you say no. in the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. you believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. in which case, you deserve the hell of the black and white christianity you so believe in. but, i don't even think you are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. i'm glad you won't. you failed to understand what i said, again. fool. people who are unconscious still have a consciousness. when you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. the same goes for comas. they have a consciousness, and therefore we know that they have a soul. a fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. to be unconscious, you must have a consciousness in the first place . until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. it has no soul. unless you can prove to me that it has a soul without having a consciousness . of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! it was human! but you know what? it wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized. unless you can prove that it had a soul without having a consciousness . no. you are sad. you are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. you're the coldest thing to ever exist. my mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. we kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died. you despicable c-... no, i'll stop from saying that insult. but you are despicable. vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. they are not comatose... they are not unconscious. they have no consciousness whatsoever. i feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. to classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct. how about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being. i'd say screw you, but you know what... i don't need to. your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. a soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness. prove to me that a soul can exist in human flesh without it having a consciousness. do it! because if you can't, you cannot prove me wrong and never will!",abortion,p-not_human,2,120.02183,23,131.33913,171,0.6027068495750427,4,0.5280193090438843

123,"what? ending a life isn't cruel? so i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. these are the cruel methods stated again: methods of termnation of pregnancy there are three abortion classificationsâ€”surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. they are defined as follows: surgical abortion: these are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. major types of surgical abortions include: suction aspiration: this is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). the abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. the suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle. dilation and curettage (d&c;): in this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. the baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb. dilation and extraction (also known as d&x;or partial-birth abortion): used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. the abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. the abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. the forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way. dilation and evacuation (d&e;): this form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). the abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. the baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth. hysterotomy: performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive cesarean section (c-section). the abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. the baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse. medical abortions: these are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. common drugs used for medical abortions include: mifepristone (ru-486): mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). this lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. the tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb. methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. it also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. when the systems fail, the baby dies. misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb. salt poisoning: this technique is used in the second and third trimester. the abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. the needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. the baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. the baby is in pain the entire time. the mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby. prostaglandins: used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. during these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving. chemical abortions: these are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are: the ortho-evraâ® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (physicians' desk reference. 60 ed. montvale, nj: thompson pdr; 2006. 2402). the nuvaringâ® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (pdr. 2357). depo-proveraâ® contraceptive injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. these actions produce its contraceptive effect (pdr 2620). plan bâ® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. in addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (pdr 1068",abortion,c-kill,3,125.473305,10,126.609566,9,0.49223899841308594,20,0.4805741310119629

128,you mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the dna which identifies us each as a human? and if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? to the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus. a fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. if the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong. the body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body. also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. in this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. and even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? and what about newborns that are one day old? don't they also feed from the body of the mother? does that makes them a parasite?,abortion,c-baby_right,6,114.74925,8,115.36058,15,0.5740064680576324,14,0.5477873086929321
129,"i am just going to repeat what i said before in different terms because i am not sure how i can make it any more clear. a fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. the fetus does not contribute anything in return. this is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. i don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what i stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return. the bodily autonomy of the woman is infringed upon if she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion. back to the patient: i admit that i am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. however, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. the person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. if they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. no matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged. if you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. it still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways. this is not the case with an inviable fetus.",abortion,p-right,17,117.43912,23,116.59013,32,0.5456644594669342,33,0.49892961978912354

131,"how can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus? when she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. this is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself. you are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. a parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. there is no proof of that in a fetus. for a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist. there is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice. do not assume i don't understand what you are trying to say. it just irrelevant. regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. but either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. it only takes, it does not return. the claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. pregnancy is extremely taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. it often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. this is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. if a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, i am sure the mental toll would also be enormous. but a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her dna and is equivalent to murder. murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well. you are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? a fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it. the fetus having possession of the mother's dna has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. your skin cells have your dna but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. this point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone. even if i did consider a fetus to be a human life, i still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. i would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. this sounds like a nightmare. the government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they must undergo or what medical procedures they may not undergo. if a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence. the reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child can depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is able to someone who will care for the child. before the fetus is viable, it cannot depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is unable to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, i would be all for this. and if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival. since this is nonsense, i am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. this does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it. -- in addition to my previous point, i would like to pose a hypothetical situation. someone has a child. when their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. only an organ transplant will save him. unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. for whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? if yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? if no, why not? after all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",abortion,p-not_human p-right p-sick_mom,4,64.237015,6,66.215805,13,0.2657672166824341,12,0.2526439428329468
132,"so the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. so would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman? check up the details of science. a human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). this homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. a parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. a human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. when a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host. when the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being. new evidence, presented by beer and billingham in their article, ""the embryo as a transplant"" (scientific american, april, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. this reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship. abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. what about in wade vs. roe when jane roe was charged by the da for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. she claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. she had consensual sex. that is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. you say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case webster vs. reproducitve health servies in which the u.s supreme court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life. can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?",abortion,c-baby_right,5,17.64913,7,67.34544,14,0.2928367257118225,13,0.25257551670074463

i have already given you a substantial analogy and yet you seem to thick to understand such a simple concept. i believe in god but that isn't knowledge. exactly. so don't try to claim that it is knowledge. but im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. i gave examples. are you that stupid? believe is never knowledge. and therefore, your examples are cases of false analogies. lol of course i do. it means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. too much people to carry. wrong . overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. i'm a geography scholar, see. so don't try and pull any stunts with geographical terminology with me ;) t relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. which is a contradiction. gosh, you're really not that intelligent are you? if you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? when we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. if this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong. let's break down your arguments: p1: in a society with only female homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens. p2: history is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. ergo c: homosexuality is wrong. response to premise 1 : first, why does it have to be only female homosexuals? second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". according to the oed, ""society"" refers to ""association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" on the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""a totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" so, while homosexuality might not increase the population size , this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack. response to premise 2 : it is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. furthermore, i've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense. and therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water. if a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. one problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. if homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. in this case, homosexuality is right. i have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part. there is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality, overpopulation will not occur. as i have shown, your definition of overpopulation is flawed. again i repeat, i am well learned in geography and demography, so don't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me. we can have homosexuality, but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children, overpopulation might still occur. furthermore, it does not mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry, then everyone will turn homosexual. there still will be heterosexuals and in fact, there won't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway. when i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. a person can be both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time. i have shown that both your arguments are fallacious. you are wrong on both arguments at the same time. if i murdered adolf hitler, im wrong for taking a life. however, im right for saving the jewish people from cruel torment. you have asserted to claims without evidence. first, how are you wrong for taking the life of hitler? and second, where is the proof that hitler is the source of most of the suffering of the jewish people? i believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. a rapist cannot try to rape a person. he has already rape d a person. that is an incredibly stupid statement to make. however, i am also right for saving a life. committing murder is not a characteristic of rapists. look at china. they feared of overpopulation. therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy."" the one child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of mao zedong, who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress. the primary reason for the one child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. while it might or might not be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in china relative to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in china. i know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar but it does share similarities. huh? what were you smoking when you said this? the policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. also, there are exemption to rural married couples. wrong. that is only after the revision of the policy. the original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child. did you know that there were on average 33 forced abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the one child policy?

582,"the right to vote has nothing to do with marriage benefits i think it does in that a democracy can at times tend toward a tyranny of the majority over the minority â€“ if women canâ€™t vote, it takes a majority of people (or, as in the case of constitutional amendments 2/3 of both houses and 3/4 of all state legislatures) who must give them that right, and if a majority of law makers are not gay, it still takes a majority of those law makers to agree to make gay marriage legal. i see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle i believe you are right . i think the battle to get civil unions is not only a compromise that will still end up maintaining at least some semantic distinction between gay couples and heterosexual couples who will still say married, etc. â€“ i think it is actually more of an uphill battle rather than an easier one. as i tried to explain in my argument above, to institute civil unions nationwide, you would have to go through the entire us code and replace all references to marriage, with civil unions. additionally, you would likely still have to fight in every single state to get the laws changed to recognize those unions. even treaties that deal with recognition of us marriages overseas would likely be affected, and who knows what else. repealing doma would allow just one state to legalize gay marriage and all other states would recognize it like they do the marriages that take place in other states today. the only reason not to use the word marriage is to appease bigots who somehow find the idea of two people loving each other unbearable if those two people happen to have the same naughty parts. i think past compromises like donâ€™t ask donâ€™t tell intentionally left policy in an inherently unmaintainable state that is bound to be overturned in the future and therefore had a modicum of acceptability, but civil unions do not possess that attribute as prominently and would only be reconsidered if that semantic difference grew into something more. i'm not against gay marriage me either - it should be legal...",gayRights,p-normal,4,105.07466,6,109.27932,13,0.5912647247314453,12,0.5766502022743225

809,"thanks for making my point. your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage. you said ""marriage is a contract"" it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage. a contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract; it doesn't make the thing. see this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject. for example lets say i wanted to define you and i said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no i'm not, i'm a.... see i would do better in describing you as you actually are. so it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is. and historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation. which leads us to the next question. ""when two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners?"" in the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids. why does that matter to the state? consider the following report; http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/docs/ costofdivorce.pdf so yes, this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it. and primarily because marriages produce the next generation. you said"" the human spirit should be without bonds"" this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil, not to mention the question of this debate. people doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society, it's why we have laws. if we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary. but let me ask you, what is more creative and productive, the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind? before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write, with out which you couldn't have this debate. final thought. you said ""don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect."" heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do. how is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say ""a"" is the same as ""non-a""",gayRights,c-abnormal,36,137.67609,46,129.8207,49,0.6253874003887177,57,0.6105610728263855

939,"heterosexual marriage laws the ground work for a relationship that creates and raises children. (sperm + egg). now, the goverment gives many benefits economically, tax wise, etc to married couples. [2] the reason they only give them to traditional couples is because of their ability to procreate. having children is the only way to continue society and advance our culture and race. as the heterosexual couples are the only people who can advance society in this way, and well pay back the benefits they get through marriage, then they deserve a state recognition. the goverment makes laws based of of interests, and their interest in this case is procreation. therefore allowing gay marriage would be unjust as it debars the special recognition the heterosexual couples deserve. people who are pro gay marriage usually have the claims that marriage is about love, but this is far from true. if marriage is about love, then why is the state involved? they are involved due to some sort of interest. if the goverment cared about love, then they would attempt to regulate and control friendships or non marital relationships. the reason they regulate marriage over these other relationships is because marriage is where you are meant to produce a larger workforce. the reason they do not regulate other relationships is because they have no good reason to do so, at all. the goverment in marriage needs two things: 1) legal commitment, 2) procreation and the ability to raise a child. a boyfriend girlfriend relationship may produce offspring in the process, but as they are not legally binding situation it is easier for them to break apart, and they will not be able to raise the child. a homosexual relationship will be lacking the legal bind, and the ability to produce offspring. even if we did give them a legal bind, they would not be able to create children therefore not fulfilling the states interest fully. one argument used against the procreation argument is the infertile argument. this objection is a misunderstood rebuttal, they do not understand the debate at point. the argument is not fully based of of the ability to reproduce, but rather a type of relationship in which procreation is possible to start off. it is not an argument fully based of of the argument they can make kids, but also an argument based of of the ability to have the similar effect, a procreative type union. my opponent without a doubt will start to argue as marriage has benefits isn't it fair homosexuals receive them too? any society, goverment, or institution that distinguishes marriage in a certain way will prohibit some types of marriage. a prohibition of ssm does not violate the equal protection clause as we must first have a definition of what marriage is. you cannot confirm that a ssm ban is unconstitutional unless we determine exactly what marriage is, and what it is for. [3] it is only unconstitutional if they are unjustly debarred the right. ex: is it unconstitutional if we debar a murderer from a gun? no. that is a just cause, and with my secular case against gay marriage i have proven they are justly debarred the right. by saying it is unconstitutional you are saying it discriminates without just cause, and that this group deserves the right. as murderers do not deserve a right to a gun, then it is constitutional. in the states eyes homosexual couples cannot produce offspring therefore do not fulfill states interest, and do not deserve the right. just because something may have inherent good effects does not mean they deserve the legal benefits. the challenge to my opponent, and the argument he needs to press is: what are the states interest in giving these couples rights? if the state has no reason to give you benefits then why should they? marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits. last statement: 1."" heterosexual union is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society). 2. the indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value. 3. what has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction. 4. civil ordinances which recognize gay marriage as comparable to heterosexual marriage constitute a rejection of the special value of heterosexual unions. 5. to deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust. 6. therefore, gay marriage is unjust.""[1] http://wisdomandfollyblog. com/2008/10/02/ an-argument-against-gay-marriage/ http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/ marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html sherif girgis, robert p. george, and ryan t. anderson, ""what is marriage?""

1129,"i think the biggest reason that marijuana is illegal is a cultural one. if you've never smoked it, it's hard to describe how it makes you feel. the best way i can put it is that it relaxes you enough for you to notice the world around you. it slows the momentum of life so that you are more aware of your environment. this leads me to my next part. it's going to require a leap, so follow me. the only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. most everything can be understood under this one assumption. the main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. our government is a client of corporations. it's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. they invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money. a requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. this brings me to my conclusion. when you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (what do i truly need?) you start to ask questions like, ""do i really need that many things?"", ""is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a ""boss""?""

1138,"the argument you are putting forth goes against the principle that the country's population can be trusted to make their own decisions as long as no-one else is harmed. marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol. furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth. most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. the same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength. also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. the idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. the lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't. in conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves. that isn't even touching on the other benefits of legalisation, including freeing up space in the over-crowded prison system, providing an additional source of government income in the form of tax and freeing up police time to tackle violent crimes.",marijuana,p-legal p-not_addictive p-other p-right,31,65.933464,41,65.52216,163,0.6394926309585571,164,0.6267498135566711

1215,"the reason i don't like marijuana, alcohol, hard drugs, and certain kinds of prescription medications is rather simple: i don't think people should sacrifice who they are, in some cases their free will or their humanity. when someone gives up their free will by becoming a slave to a hard drug or prescription mood and personality altering chemicals it is time for society to step in and give them back control. marijuana may be a petty offender, much less of an offender than alcohol, tobacco, meth, cocaine..etc.., but it is still a means of giving up who you are or keeping yourself in a state of non-growth. we, as human beings, have a duty to ourselves to grow, change, improve, but always in the context of who we are. drugs are a way to retard this development, deny who we are, and cope with a world that rejects us. it is an escape; an escape which noone deserves. i don't mind people escaping in other ways: video games, reading, television, camping..etc, at least they are still thinking, at least their self is still intact and operating. when people do drugs they stop being people and start being mr. or ms. x+meth, or x+marijuana, or x+alcohol. it isn't helpful; it's downright harmful in the long-run. governments and societies are meant to protect us; usually from dangers outside. this danger, this threat is unique in its internal, self-inflicted nature. again, marijuana is only a petty offender in this case; which is why i am not adamant about its status as an illegal narcotic. there are far worse legal drugs which i am much more concerned with. does that help in explaining my objection to its use? i am still forming my opinion on this one so i know my logic is abit choppy and in some cases exaggerated.",marijuana,c-health c-other,17,130.92049,23,131.53726,130,0.24699795246124268,138,0.2511838674545288
1216,"i think you aren't well educated on what cannabis can actually do for society. did you know that if cannabis were legalized that it could replace the lumber industry with a renewable, green house resource? it requires no pesticides to grow, the pesticides companies don't like that. big lumber are the guys who got the crop made illegal back in 1937. crashes under impairment would likely go down, as many bars might adopt marijuana instead of alcohol. orp people might start smoking instead of drinking. studies have shown that impairment while driving (while not encouraged ,and should have a limit, like alcohol. keep in mind we didn't develop one before re-legalizing it in 1937.) other studies show that cannabis going illegal at the same time alcohol became legal again was a gift to organized crime. see, organized crime didn't exist the way it did (or at all) before alcohol prohibition. that literally changed the face of our nation. marijuana and other drug prohibition changed everything as well. it (marijuana) is responsible for 70% of drug cartel income. we can end that with legalization. industrial benefits of hemp: can make 2x4 and other building material that is 2-4x stronger than wood. lasts longer. 25,000 different products, 5,000 known textiles (that was in 1938!). they are looking into making polymer with it. like those high grade plastics used in, well, almost everything. from guns to blow dryers, etc. etc. this would make a more environmentally-friendly version. same with paper, our constitution is written on hemp paper. george washington smoked hemp, and grew it, even telling others to do it. benjamin franklin had a hemp paper mill. and news press. hemp paper is the highest quality paper in the world. and completely renewable and eco-friendly. industrial hemp can be grown en-mass with very little thc, making thieves unlikely. plus it could be grown as a number one cash crop from cali to utah to nebraska and most of the bible-belt states. did i mention you can build the body for a car using hemp polymer? even space shuttles and planes! then you can fuel them using hemp-fuel that has zero carbon emissions. ""why isn't it legal if it's so great?"" you ask? well, it's simple. big biz, pharm, tobacco (although they will be changing their mind, surely), alcohol, lumber, oil, people who in the pocket of the cartels, etc. don't want that. enough of them got enough people tricked to keep this going for years. recent tests also show that smoking or inhaling, or otherwise ingesting cannabis can increase your brain cell growth. in 40 years of constant usage no user of just marijuana has ever gotten cancer or otherwise ill effects. something would have shown up. dr. lester grinspoon, md professor emeritus, harvard medical school ""there are no deaths from cannabis"" -can be seen in the documentary ""the union: the business of getting high"" watch that on topdocumentryfilms.com and then research and judge for yourself. please!",marijuana,p-legal p-medicine p-no_damage p-not_addictive p-other,31,131.87738,41,128.10048,131,0.30211955308914185,139,0.3067735433578491

1504,"then are you saying that taxation doesn't matter? it's more about the tyranny behind taxation. in the terrible shit-storm that government has created thus far, it is almost impossible to eliminate most taxes today. however, we should be progressing past the need for taxation all together. create a new system dependent on proper justification for spending and taxation (if necessary). the taxes today are irresponsible and incomprehensible by average americans. many people have to pay someone just so they don't accidentally miss any payments. the tax bracket is better now than it has been at times, but it is unrealistic. taxes on capital gains are basically taxing the same income twice. taxes for subsidizing wheat and corn, and products made by wheat and corn are taxed. most states have sales tax asking that people pay the government if they wish to buy an item. taxes on property, saying that you can't even have shelter without paying the government. this is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil. the idea that an authority figure can charge you for buying something from someone else is kind of ridiculous, yet it is currently the case. so it's not so wise to just say ""yeah, taxes should go up because what about the debt?"" the debt is from irresponsible spending from the government. the government is now asking us to pay for their mistakes. furnishings that don't even benefit most of us. tj called this shit tyrannical for a reason. pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something. the number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government. higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate. people do not end their pursuit of profit just because government has made things more expensive for them. they will simply pass the expenses unto the consumer, as we have seen with the healthcare and agricultural businesses. as there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions. as shown, historically (as i've pointed out a few times already), private endeavors succeed far more in spreading wealth across the nation than public efforts. this is because government has no concern for efficiency. while welfare and social services may be for noble reasons, they have been unsuccessful in getting people out of the slums. allowing businesses to operate unrestricted creates growth. more goods and services are provided at a cheaper rate because the business men want to make these items cheaply. they don't want expensive items. expensive items mean less consumers. as well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically). it goes all the way back to the bourgeoisie and we see it today with the monopolies created solely by government. the largest of corporations owe most of their strength to government regulations and restrictions that have hurt small business, subsidization and contracts that has chosen winners, and ridiculous business taxes that small businesses couldn't keep up with. those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within us politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market. the ""corporatist"" legislation includes major regulations on the market. government should not have the power to put such restrictions on individuals, yet we give it that power by claims of non-trust for the free market. free markets is very far from corporatism. those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities. even if we look to a futuristic utopia where the free market has prevailed over tyrannical government, government's place will still be to provide basic needs (security, vouchers for food and healthcare) at a much cheaper and efficient rate. however, government currently is a bureaucratic mess and the only defense that people can have for it all is the fear of an alternative that has never done harm (in fact, 'regression' towards free markets has done wonders for the economies of the ussr and china). vouchers (like food stamps, or the paul ryan healthcare plan) are cheaper and allow the market to do what it does best, compete for customers. it's a system of welfare that is efficient and i have no problem with it. that is currently, however, not what government does. i love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive. hardly. the expense of most food industries comes from heavy regulation and taxation. one is not allowed to sell food without going through months of expensive protocol. how can a poor person in a poor neighborhood afford to do that or keep up with all business regulations and fees? this is what impoverishes the people the most. a neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them. i seem to remember you posting a link that showed that obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes as explained, the buffet rule is a ""red herring."" the government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago i believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession. way to leave out the most important part. when the recession was occurring, the icelandic government panicked and made drastic action believing that the banks wouldn't be able to handle the downfall of the european union's dollar (the eu had much to do with this, sir). iceland surrendered ownership of their banks to government regulators and this is where all hell broke loose. now, the development of the banks was already a fault of government, as government, as i explained before, should have nothing to do with the banks. no start up help, no subsidies, no regulations, no nothing. iceland would not have been able to invest so much power into three banks if they had completely avoided that market. as i've stated, it is better to either have a centralized bank or no government involvement with banks at all. i'd choose the latter, especially today, because of the great catastrophe government has created in the banking and currency systems. now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). it's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement if government had stayed out of it all along, none of this would have been an issue. iceland would have been one of the countries to avoid the mess that the eu and us created with their meddling in the private sector. (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. i understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people. the regulators of the fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed. they now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure). with a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please? is it government's role to build up such monstrous corporations only to try and tame them and make them take care of us poor folk who need a nanny state? i find it quite shaky when we say ""hey frankenstein, make us one of them monsters to push us around."" i'm sorry i trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that. and i don't trust them as economic advisers. for good reason, it's not very good to give the religious a voice in politics. but that's just my opinion. it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me. sure, but saying that still doesn't make a difference in what we're talking about.",obama,c-economy,35,130.38382,45,130.1134,136,0.45509612560272217,145,0.4720063805580139

1506,"it's more about the tyranny behind taxation. while i don't disagree that taxes do need a justification (which i feel is there, but am currently unable to provide - only heard of libertarianism a few months ago, i'll think of something), in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important. this is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil. is it not (somewhat) balanced out by the fact that the money is (mostly) spent on the people? the number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government. you don't get what i'm saying :( my issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me. obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that i like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality. the value or number of dollars has little do with that. as well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically). i disagree. i feel that taxes or no, in the globalized world we live in, economies of scale has such an advantage that they are able to push people out of business with ease. remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (scandanavian ones come to mind). free markets is very far from corporatism. i meant simply in the way that people spend money on goods or services that they wish to possess, and people offer them. i did not mean that corporatism encouraged the free market, or is in any way good. it's a system of welfare that is efficient and i have no problem with it. the ryan plan calls for little reform (as far as i am aware, feel free to call me out on that if i am wrong), but simply cuts people from government provision to save money. a neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them. i agree that this is a major problem, i have many complaints for the current government (obama included, this started off as me defending his impact on debt), and over-regulation is one of them. as explained, the buffet rule is a ""red herring."" there is much more to the tax debate than the buffet rule. your article claimed that he was unable to raise taxes on the rich in anyway, pushing millionaires' taxes to 30% is only part of it. way to leave out the most important part. the banks damage was done at that point, one bank went into voluntary administration before it was taken over. so no, i don't feel that the government was the cause of the crash, the high risk, over-leveraged, under-regulated banking bubble was the cause of the icelandic crash. the regulators of the fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed. the housing market crashed because of banks, cdo's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers. out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them? with a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please? funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same. and i don't trust them as economic advisers. an economy is nothing but a system of allocation of resources to fulfill the needs and wants of society. i trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately. i would not trust them to suggest an alternative system, just as i would never presume to do the same, but the commentary they provide is not worthless.",obama,p-republicans,31,109.67732,41,113.05397,162,0.6131779253482819,163,0.6449620723724365
1507,"in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important. bill clinton had a different view on things. it was about having taxes that can match the spending. however, if spending is out of control, increasing taxes doesn't help. this is why clinton cut spending so much that taxes could actually be cut instead of needing any raise, while still having an annual surplus. my issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me. you're ignoring some of my points on a voucher program, but even so, it makes little sense to reward others for doing nothing. as well, as explained, government services provide a lot less to the public than private services. this is simply because pursuit of wealth increases overall wealth. people have more in capitalistic countries than in collectivist countries. this is what the ussr witnessed when they privatized more industries, and this was the biggest realization for china as they went from communist to practically laissez-faire economics. obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that i like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality. socialistic policies do not increase the amount of goods and services available to people (unless you include militaristic policies that have been the only historical instance where massive government spending has actually benefited the citizens in in their wants). food and clean water supply goes up with private industries' efforts to make more money. consumers want goods and services, private forces provide them. if you're worried about the poor, a voucher program (that would cut down spending and regulation greatly) would benefit them far more than a public service. vouchers would give them the ability to choose at little to no cost to themselves. however, socialistic policies of government services and regulation only make things harder for the poor. remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (scandanavian ones come to mind). i've given my explanation on scandanavia and prayerfails has given a different but also effective one as well. wealth equality doesn't mean jack shit if the overall wealth is still low. the ryan plan calls for little reform the current ryan plan is to appeal to the mainstream democrats who hated his voucher program for healthcare. over-regulation is one of them general regulation does this. unless you mean regulation only in rich neighborhoods... the housing market crashed because of banks, cdo's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers. it came from government incentives to ""look out for the poor"" who were actually the risky loans. it came from government taxes on businesses that didn't make these high risks. out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them? i feel that you completely ignored my points that regulators should have no say in any of the business of the banks, and that general government should give absolutely no rewards to banks for any reasons. no subsidies, no tax incentives, no regulation, no interest fondling, and no bail-outs. government should view banks as another business and should have no concern for them. this will remove their power over all of us who depend greatly on government currency yet require private industries to provide us with this government provision. funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same. explain. i trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately. why? forgive me, but this may just be my issue with debate in general, when others look to their pastors and school teachers as experts on very complex issues (especially to justify the surrendering of liberty for the sake of security that has never been shown to exist or be successful). but the commentary they provide is not worthless. to you, maybe. to me, it is very worthless.",obama,c-decision_policies,17,117.11293,52,114.246155,139,0.6004016995429993,147,0.631691038608551

""blame the republicans. it's really their fault."" that just shows how uneducated everyone in his fan-club is. the simple fact is that every single one of the last presidents saw the recession coming, but no one really knew how to stop it. now that it's here, obama doesn't know how to fix it. the fact is that the fault crosses party lines. however, obama had congress in the palm of his hand for two years and they did everything he wanted. they authorized bailout after bailout, and let him spend as much as he pleased. now common sense can tell you that when you don't have any money, you need to stop spending as much. the republicans won't agree with him because he spends way too much and won't negotiate. negotiating actually involves both parties giving up something they want so that both parties can get something they do want.",obama,c-economy,48,162.07013,60,161.51776,162,0.5204881429672241,163,0.5004312098026276
1900,i think obama has been a great president. i think the most important thing he has done is make the us a bit more human on the international scale.,obama,p-foreign_policies,43,102.1023,55,102.73018,170,0.5150816440582275,170,0.5360665619373322
